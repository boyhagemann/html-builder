# html-builder
A proof-of-concept setup for build SPA pages with a JSON config file

### Guidelines
* The JSON config should be the glue between a back-end and front-end implementation.
* All information for a full-blown html page should be in the JSON config.

## Config structure
* nodes (the html tree structure)
* events (the action triggers)

## Roadmap
* [x] Build html from the JSON
* [x] Bind events to html identifiers
* [ ] Reuse components with own event scope
